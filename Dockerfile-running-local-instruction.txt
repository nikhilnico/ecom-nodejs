Running the Application

Once everything is set up, you can build and run the services using Docker Compose. From the root of your project, run:

docker-compose up --build


The --build flag ensures that Docker rebuilds the images if necessary (e.g., if there are changes in the Dockerfile).

This will start the NestJS API, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch services defined in docker-compose.yml.

You can now access your API at http://localhost:3000.

Step 5: Access Services

NestJS API: Access the backend at http://localhost:3000.

PostgreSQL: Connect to PostgreSQL at localhost:5432.

Redis: Connect to Redis at localhost:6379.

Elasticsearch: Access Elasticsearch at http://localhost:9200.
